# Soccer Tournament <br><br>

**Group 1:** It's composed by the eight winners of the group stage.
**Group 2:** It's composed by the eight runners-up of the group stage.

This software generates matches of the round of 16. The system is based on the format of Copa do Brasil and Libertadores da América, where the contenders of the **group 1** play against the contenders of the **group 2**.

The official matches are decided by a "draw", where a team of group 1 is will play against a team of group 2.
 
So to simulate the process in this software, both of the groups are shuffled and the first ones of each suffled group will play each other. To examplify:

Initially the **group 1** is composed by Palmeiras, Internacional, Barcelona SC, Fluminense, Racing, Argentinos Jr, Flamengo and Atlético-MG. The **group 2** is composed by Defensa y Justicia, Olimpia, Boca Juniors, River Plate, São Paulo, Universidad Católica, Vélez and Cerro Porteño. Then, the software will suffle the groups, generating something like this:

**group 1:** 



and then will match-up the teams.
